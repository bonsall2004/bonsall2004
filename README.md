## ðŸ’« About Me

I am a C/C++ Developer currently studying a masters degree in computer science, I love all things low level, from writing C++ libraries to getting down and dirty with x86 Assembly. 

___***Hot Take:*** I like to use CMake___

Check out my repositories, maybe you'll find a library that you really need and didn't want to make or maybe it'll be a nice read. Please feel free to report any issues or optimisations to me using git issues.

### Languages I use
- C/C++
- x86 Assembly (not a language but idc)
- JavaScript
- Java
- Python
